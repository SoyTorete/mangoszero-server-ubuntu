The default files for ACE_LITE were ammended in commit:

https://github.com/mangos/mangosDeps/commit/52e4c984dbca474f7a4353b444339067a95ea277

these will need to be reapplied should a new version be added.


Note:
On MacOS X, the ACE_UINT64_TYPE should be defined as follows in ace/config-macosx-leopard.h

#define ACE_UINT64_TYPE unsigned long long
